This code exhibits a common yet subtle error in PHP related to how it handles variable scope and references within functions.  The issue is that the `&$var` notation doesn't just pass by reference in terms of modification; it also means that the function operates directly on the passed variable. Any changes made to `$var` inside the function will affect the original variable outside of the function.

```php
<?php
function modifyArray(array &$arr) {
  $arr[] = 4;
}

$myArray = [1, 2, 3];
modifyArray($myArray);
print_r($myArray); // Output: Array ( [0] => 1 [1] => 2 [2] => 3 [3] => 4 )

function modifyArrayCopy(array $arr) {
  $arr[] = 4;
  return $arr;
}

$myArray = [1, 2, 3];
$myArray = modifyArrayCopy($myArray);
print_r($myArray); // Output: Array ( [0] => 1 [1] => 2 [2] => 3 [3] => 4 )
?>
```
